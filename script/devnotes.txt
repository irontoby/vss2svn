DEVELOPMENT NOTES - VSS2SVN 0.10+

These are the development notes for the "new, improved" vss2svn script. Previous
versions (0.1 - 0.3) were based on parsing output from Microsoft's ss.exe tool.
The script was rewritten to instead use the ssphys.exe command-line tool, which
is the result of a reverse-engineering effort on the VSS backend database files.

SQLITE SCHEMA

All information about the conversion is stored in a SQLite version 2 database,
using the DBD::SQLite Perl module. This is a wholly self-contained DBMS which
offers SQL syntax, transactions, and a single database file. It is available in
ActiveState's PPM repository, which means it is pre-compiled for Windows users.

Following is a description of the SQLite schema used by this project:

    'Physical' table : list of physical VSS files
        physname (VARCHAR)  : name of physical VSS file
                              
    'NameLookup' table: references to item names from VSS names.dat
        offset              : primary key; byte offset from names.dat file
        name                : item name
    
    'PhysicalAction' : history of actions as they pertain to physical VSS files
        physname (VARCHAR)  : name of physical VSS file
        type (VARCHAR)      : type of action (ADD, RENAME, LABEL, etc.)
        itemname (VARCHAR)  : name of item being acted upon
        itemtype (INTEGER)  : 1 = project
                              2 = file
        timestamp (INTEGER) : timestamp in VSS internal format
                              (seconds since Jan. 1, 1970)
        author (VARCHAR)    : name of user who performed action
        info (VARCHAR)      : action-specific info (such as previous name on
                              renames)
        comment (TEXT)      : user-supplied comment for this action
        
    'Action' : history of actions on logical VSS items (files/projects)
        action_id (INTEGER) : primary key for Action table
        type (VARCHAR)      : type of action (ADD, RENAME, LABEL, etc.)
        itempath (VARCHAR)  : path to item being acted upon
        itemtype (INTEGER)  : 1 = project
                              2 = file

        comment (TEXT)      : user-supplied comment for this action        

    'Revision' table: contains information about eventual atomic SVN revisions
        revision_id (INT.)  : primary key for Revision table
        svndate (VARCHAR)   : svn:date formatted timestamp
        author (VARCHAR)    : name of author for this atomic revision
        comment (TEXT)      : comment for this atomic revision
        status              : 0 = revision has been imported to SVN
                              1 = revision not yet imported

    'RevisionAction' table: many-to-many link between Revision and Action
        revision_id (INT.)  : primary key for Revision table
        action_id (INTEGER) : primary key for Action table

NOTES ON PHYSICAL VS. LOGICAL NAMES IN VSS

Every item in the VSS repository, whether a file or project, is represented on
the backend by a "physical" file. The name of this physical file never changes,
even if the name of the corresponding "logical" version-controlled item does
change.

Unfortunately, only the original name for any item is stored in that item's
physical file. If it is renamed (whether it is a project or a regular file),
information about the rename is stored in the physical file of its *parent*
instead.

This makes it rather difficult to figure out what name an item actually had when
an action was performed on it. For this reason, we must maintain a history of
all the names that an item ever had and the timestamp when that name became
effective, so we can cross-reference this information during reconstruction of
its history. This is the purpose of the 'ItemNameHistory' table.

The problem is compounded by the fact that we must figure out not only the name
of a particular item at a given point in time, but also the name of its parent
folder and all its ancestor folders at that moment as well. Luckily, physical
files are created in an easily determined order, and because a file
